    HTML and CSS
    <notes>HTML and CSS are used to created content for web pages. HTML provides the structure for the content; CSS provides the style. </notes>
  </div>

  <div>
    <img src='images/htmlpage.jpg' alt="an html page" /> 
    <notes>This is an example of HTML. HTML isn’t a programming language, is a markup language.  The acronym stands for Hypertext Markup Language. A markup language is a way to annotate content that is not shown when the content it is displayed. It is instructions for the browser on what to do with the content of the page. HTML is the markup language used by web browsers.  </notes>

  <div>
    <img src='images/extension.jpg' alt="saving a document with an HTML extension" /> 

  
    <notes>You create an HTML file by using the extension .html when you save a file. By using this extension, the browser will know to expect HTML. </notes>
  </div>

  <div>
    <img src='images/examplepage.jpg' alt="the web page example.com" /> 

  
    <notes>If you look at this site which is example.com </notes>
  </div>

  <div>
    <img src='images/examplehtml.jpg' alt="an example html page" /> 
    <notes>This is the HTML for it. HTML helps the browsers to format the content of the page. HTML gives your page structure, you can define headers, headings, paragraphs images and links. You can create different blocks of content and have consistent styling. It also makes your page more accessible, it helps screen readers to read the page. It also provides the structure so you can style your page using CSS. </notes>
  </div>

  <div>
    <img src='images/element.jpg' alt="an HTML element" /> 
    <notes>HTML elements are normally made up of an opening and closing tag. The opening tag will contain the name of the type of element enclosed by a left and right-angled bracket. The closing tags are similar, but have a forward slash before the element type. </notes>
  </div>

  <div>
    <img src='images/htmlAttributes.jpg' alt="an HTML element" /> 
    <notes>In the opening tag you can also add optional attributes. These attributes could be to give the element an id or class name as an identifier, or the location and information about an image. </notes>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h1 style="float: left;background-color: black; color: white; padding: 2px; font-size: 36px; margin-bottom: 5px;">DOM</h1>
    <img src='images/dom.jpg' alt="a diagram of the HTML DOM" style="width: 80%; height: 80%;"/> 
    <notes>DOM stands for Document Object Model, it is a representation of an HTML. When a browser opens an HTML page it first goes through the HTML, it parses is HTML and creates a tree of the page with the elements as its nodes. It then parses the CSS and combines the relevant CSS to the HTML elements on the DOM. </notes>

  <div>
    <img src='images/exampleInspector.jpg' alt="the open inspector for the web site example.com" style="width: 120%; height: 120%; margin-left: -10%" /> 
    <notes>So if you go to a web site, I’ve gone to example.com, and open the developer tools. On a Mac press command + option + I,  on a Windows PC press control + shift + i; 

      You can see the structure of the HTML,  and the DOM is made from this </notes>

  <div>
    CSS
    <notes>CSS stands for cascading style sheets, they are files  used to style your web page. With different CSS the same HTML can look very different.  </notes>
  </div>

  <div>
    <img src='images/zen1.jpg' alt="an example page from the zen garden website" /> 
    <notes>This is a page from a site called css zen garden, people use the same HTML page, and using CSS make it look very different</notes>
  </div>

  <div>
    <img src='images/zen2.jpg' alt="an example page from the zen garden website" /> 
    <notes>Here is how someone else styled it 
    </notes>
  </div>

  <div>
    <img src='images/zen3.jpg' alt="an example page from the zen garden website" /> 
    <notes>And this is another example, all three have the same HTML, the same content, but have been styled differently with CSS. With CSS you can change so much, including colors, positions and fonts and you can animate content as well. </notes>
  </div>

  <div>
    <img src='images/css.jpg' alt="a css example" /> 
    <notes>After the selector you use curly brackets to enclose the declarations, which has a property, in this case color, which changes the color of the font. The property is given a value, in this case the color is a hexadecimal number. The property and value are separated by a semi colon. You can have multiple declarations for a selector.  </notes>
  </div>

  <div>
    <img src='images/box model.jpg' alt="a css box model" /> 
    <notes>All HTML elements have a box around them, the box model, that is processed by the browser. This box will affect how they are displayed on the page. The box consists of the content, padding, a border and a margin.
