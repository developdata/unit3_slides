    <h1>PLAY</h1>
    <notes>Alongside technical aspects of physical computing there will be some workshops to explore the non-technical aspects. These will look at areas such as privacy and security and inclusive design, and this week's topic is play. As I said in week 1, I have based a lot of the exploration of physical computing around play. Play can be so many things, and it lets you explore interactions and engagement with the audience. 

    In my work I have only recently come back to play. Previously I worked as an animator in a games company, but over time moved into information graphics.  </notes>
