    STRUCTURE AND CODE
    <notes>This week’s workshop will be looking at the structure of code in projects. It will include JavaScript, HTML and CSS.  

      I will go through ways to think about code, and how to take an idea and make it in code. </notes>

  <div>
    <img src='images/p5.jpg' alt="a p5.js project on a web page" /> 

    <notes>I will also walk through how to put a p5.js project on a web page, and then use that example to go through how to create separate JavaScript and CSS files for a web page.  

      When you have an idea, you want to create that uses coding, it can be hard to break it down into the code you need. I’m going to break down an everyday action and then think how I would write that in code.  </notes>

  <div>
    <img src='images/tea.jpg' alt="a cup of tea with the teabag being taken out" style="width: 120%; height: 120%" /> 

  
    <notes>I’m going to think about making a cup of tea. The stages I go through when I make a cup of tea are: 

      Turn the kettle on if it has water in it, if not fill it with water and then turn it on. Get a mug out of the cupboard and put a teabag in it. </notes>
